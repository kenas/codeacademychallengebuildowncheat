            <h2>HTML - stands for HyperText Markup Language</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is like the structure of the book itself. It's the backbone 
                    that organizes everything. Just as the book's structure decides 
                    where chapters, paragraphs, and pictures go, HTML determines where 
                    the content, pictures, headings, and links will be placed on the webpage. 
                    HTML is the framework that gives order and meaning to the story, 
                    setting the stage for CSS (the illustrations) to make it 
                    visually appealing.
                </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Tags</th>
                        <th>Descriptions</th>
                    </tr>

                <tbody>

                        <td><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></pre></td>
                        <td>as the book's table of contents or the cover page description. 
                            It tells the browser about the type of document it's going to read, just 
                            like the table of contents gives an overview of what chapters are in the book. 
                            It sets the stage for the browser, saying, 
                            "Hey, get ready to read an HTML5 book!" It's like the first page of 
                            our book, providing the browser with information about the structure of 
                            the content it's about to display.

                        <td>as the title of the book. It's at the top of the webpage and 
                            usually holds important info like the title of the story 
                            (the website's name) and maybe some chapter titles 
                            (like links to different parts of the site). 
                            It's like the big, bold title at the top of each page 
                            n a book that tells you what the page is all about!
                        </td>

                        <td>is like the title of the book. It appears at the top of the browser 
                            tab and tells readers (or in this case, users) what the page is all about. 
                            It's the name of our book that appears on the cover, helping people know 
                            what they're reading

                        <td>is like closing the cover of the book. It encapsulates the 
                            title, signaling the end of the title declaration within the HTML 
                            document. It's a closing tag that tells the browser that the title 
                            content is complete and everything within the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tags represents the title of the webpage.</td>

                    <td><pre><code>&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre></td>
                        <td>
                            is like the end of the title page. It finishes off the top part 
                            of the webpage where all the important introductory info is stored.
                        </td>

                        <td>
                            is where the story really happens in our web book. 
                            It's like all the pages filled with the adventure, 
                            pictures, and words. Everything you see and read on a 
                            webpage, from the text to the images and even the fun stuff 
                            like videos and games, happens inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. 
                            It's where the exciting part of our online story unfolds!

                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td><pre><code>&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre></td>
                        <td>
                            is like a magical portal or a hidden pathway within the story. 
                            It's an anchor or a link that transports readers (or users) to another 
                            part of the same book or even to a completely different book (webpage) when 
                            clicked. Just as a magical portal in a book takes you to a different realm or 
                            adventure, <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;</code> takes you to a different part of the story or even to a 
                            different webpage on the internet when you click on it.</td>

                        <td>
                            is like an illustration or a picture within our book. 
                            It's a visual element that brings the story to life by 
                            displaying images. Just as illustrations in a book provide visual 
                            context to the story, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> in HTML displays images on the 
                            webpage, helping to convey information or enhance the narrative 
                            with visuals. Each <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag represents a different image, 
                            just as each illustration in a book depicts a different scene or concept.
                        </td>

                        <td>
                            is like the end of the main story.
                            It tells the computer, "Okay, that's the last page of the adventure!"
                        </td>

                        <td>
                            is like the end of a book where you find the closing 
                            remarks or a cool note from the author. It's at the bottom 
                            of the webpage and often has things like contact info, 
                            copyright details, or links to other important pages. 
                            Just like the end of a story where you might find 
                            the author's final words or a sneak peek at the next 
                            adventure, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> wraps up our web page adventure!

                            It's the closing section that wraps up the webpage, providing last-minute info or links.
